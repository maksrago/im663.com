      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m 663, and this is my blog. This site was created in an attempt to aggregate my personal thoughts, interests, and useful information (such as technical guides). I&amp;rsquo;ve gone by many aliases online, the most widely known being 663, the alias that I use as the head administrator and owner of 16chan. Currently I&amp;rsquo;m in the final year of my Computer Science program.
If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in getting in contact with me, or would like me to answer any questions regarding content on this site you can send me an email at admin@16chan.</description>
